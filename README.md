# 📊 Task 3 – Dashboard Design using Power BI

As part of my **online internship at Elevate Labs**, I completed Task 3, which focused on building an interactive business dashboard from a real-world dataset using Power BI. This task helped me explore data visualization, slicers, and storytelling techniques to convert raw data into valuable insights.

## 📁 Dataset Used

- **Source:** Provided CSV file (9,939 entries)
- **Domain:** Call Center Performance
- **Key Features:**
  - `Agent_Name`
  - `CallID`
  - `PickedUp` (1 = Picked, 0 = Missed)
  - `Duration` (Call time in seconds)
  - `ProductSold` (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel (basic preprocessing)
- Power Query Editor (for cleaning data)

---

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

### Key Visuals
- **Total Calls, Average Duration, Product Conversion %** (KPIs)
- **Call Duration Trend by Agent** (Bar Chart)
- **Picked vs Missed Calls** (100% Stacked Column Chart)
- **Product Sold by Agent** (Bar Chart)
- **Slicers**: Agent, Product Sold, PickedUp

### Interactive Slicers
- Agent-wise filtering
- Product Sold (Yes/No)
- Calls Picked or Missed

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Some agents consistently handle longer calls, which correlates with higher product sales.
- Missed calls negatively impact conversion rate.
- Certain agents drive the majority of sales.
- Dashboards help monitor agent performance in real-time.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Built an interactive dashboard from scratch
- Practiced using slicers, filters, and DAX formulas
- Improved my skills in data storytelling and performance analysis
- Understood how simple call center metrics can drive business decisions
